𐍉 𐌾𐌰...

129
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:31,928
And I've used up all of my
allowance for this month.

130
00:09:33,802 --> 00:09:36,134
Be strong, Usagi.

131
00:09:42,978 --> 00:09:45,845
I should have studied harder.

132
00:09:47,382 --> 00:09:49,680
Oh, die!

133
00:09:51,987 --> 00:09:54,322
Hey, that hurts, Dumpling Head.

134
00:09:54,322 --> 00:09:55,789
What? Oh, I'm sorry...

135
00:09:56,224 --> 00:09:57,589
30 percent!

136
00:09:59,127 --> 00:10:01,994
Study harder, Dumpling Head.

137
00:10:02,631 --> 00:10:05,031
It's none of your business!

138
00:10:07,569 --> 00:10:10,299
What's with him?! I can't believe it.

139
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:16,541
What a weirdo.

140
00:10:23,985 --> 00:10:26,954
Brand New Sailor V Game

141
00:10:30,725 --> 00:10:34,889
Huh, Sailor V?
They made a game already?

142
00:10:48,076 --> 00:10:51,079
It must be nice being Sailor V.

143
00:10:51,079 --> 00:10:52,948
You don't have to worry about tests,

144
00:10:52,948 --> 00:10:55,416
and I bet catching bad guys
feels pretty good.

145
00:11:00,488 --> 00:11:02,547
But me on the other hand...

146
00:11:05,727 --> 00:11:08,321
I don't want to take this home.

147
00:11:20,141 --> 00:11:23,110
Usagi Tsukino, I've finally found you.

148
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:47,384
*Kenji Tsukino*
*Ikuko*
*Usagi*
*Shingo*

149
00:11:47,384 --> 00:11:49,286
I'm home!
*Kenji Tsukino*
*Ikuko*
*Usagi*
*Shingo*

150
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,514
Oh, you're back. You're late.

151
00:11:53,424 --> 00:11:55,092
Yeah, a bit.

152
00:11:55,092 --> 00:11:59,620
I bumped into Umino.
He said you got your tests back.

153
00:12:00,064 --> 00:12:01,131
What?

154
00:12:01,131 --> 00:12:03,622
Umino said that he got a 95.

155
00:12:04,268 --> 00:12:06,998
Oh, really? That's amazing!

156
00:12:07,304 --> 00:12:10,398
Umino's got a big mouth.

157
00:12:10,741 --> 00:12:13,301
And what did you get, Usagi?

158
00:12:14,244 --> 00:12:18,115
Well umm. Umm, well...
Actually, that is...

159
00:12:18,115 --> 00:12:19,343
Let me see.

160
00:12:23,354 --> 00:12:24,514
Here.

161
00:12:27,658 --> 00:12:30,684
Usagi!

162
00:12:30,928 --> 00:12:31,917
Yes?

163
00:12:32,796 --> 00:12:36,129
Getting such a bad score.
I'm not letting you in the house.

164
00:12:38,469 --> 00:12:39,436
Mom!

165
00:12:39,436 --> 00:12:40,835
I can't hear you.

166
00:12:41,338 --> 00:12:41,872
Ouch!

167
00:12:41,872 --> 00:12:42,573
Ouch!
What are you doing, dummy Usagi?
Did you get locked out again?

168
00:12:42,573 --> 00:12:46,031
What are you doing, dummy Usagi?
Did you get locked out again?

169
00:12:46,276 --> 00:12:49,507
I want a better sister.

170
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:52,278
You're my younger brother.

171
00:12:53,717 --> 00:12:56,117
Sailor V kick.

172
00:12:59,723 --> 00:13:01,850
Ouch!

173
00:13:02,126 --> 00:13:05,755
Mom! Please let me in.

174
00:13:11,602 --> 00:13:14,537
That's strange. I'm feeling a bit faint.

175
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:19,933
I feel weak.

176
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:30,814
What's happening to everyone
all of a sudden? Mom?

177
00:13:31,822 --> 00:13:33,016
Mom?

178
00:13:35,492 --> 00:13:37,517
I've gathered quite a bit of energy.

179
00:13:38,996 --> 00:13:40,156
Mom...

180
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:53,310
She finally let me in.

181
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:58,873
I'm tired from crying so much.
Mom didn't have to get that mad.

182
00:14:00,884 --> 00:14:02,753
I don't feel like doing homework.

183
00:14:02,753 --> 00:14:03,921
Maybe I'll take a nap.

184
00:14:03,921 --> 00:14:07,413
It's good that I can fall asleep
so easily at times like this.

185
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:36,116
Hey, it's the cat with the
crescent bald spot.

186
00:14:36,587 --> 00:14:39,356
It's not a bald spot. How rude.

187
00:14:39,356 --> 00:14:43,417
It talked. A cat... A cat talked.

188
00:14:45,529 --> 00:14:50,125
My name is Luna. I've been
looking for you, Usagi.

189
00:14:52,503 --> 00:14:57,065
Oh, I need to thank you first.
Thank you very much.

190
00:14:57,508 --> 00:14:59,772
You really helped me out by
taking the band-aid off.

191
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:03,707
I can't talk and my sensory powers
are dulled when I'm like that.

192
00:15:03,981 --> 00:15:06,650
I was having trouble because
of that band-aid prank.

193
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:09,414
But thanks to you, I finally found you.

194
00:15:11,989 --> 00:15:13,457
Good night.

195
00:15:13,457 --> 00:15:16,392
Usagi, this is not a dream.

196
00:15:17,461 --> 00:15:19,292
C'mon, Usagi!

197
00:15:21,532 --> 00:15:24,296
Fine then, I'll wake you up!

198
00:15:25,469 --> 00:15:26,766
There!

199
00:15:35,245 --> 00:15:37,577
Usagi, this is a present for you.

200
00:15:37,848 --> 00:15:40,350
Really, I can have this?

201
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:40,617
Usagi, there are weird things
happening in Tokyo right now.

202
00:15:40,617 --> 00:15:43,654
All right! Thank you.
Usagi, there are weird things
happening in Tokyo right now.

203
00:15:43,654 --> 00:15:46,256
Usagi, listen to me!

204
00:15:46,256 --> 00:15:49,089
There are strange things happening
in Tokyo right now.

205
00:15:49,393 --> 00:15:53,386
An enemy the police can't fight.

206
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:56,656
Usagi, you're going to fight
these enemies.

207
00:15:57,201 --> 00:15:59,431
You are a chosen warrior.

208
00:16:00,837 --> 00:16:06,376
And your other mission is to find
our princess with the others.

209
00:16:06,376 --> 00:16:08,844
That sounds sorta cool.

210
00:16:09,179 --> 00:16:12,216
You still don't believe me, do you?

211
00:16:12,216 --> 00:16:14,582
No, I believe you, I believe you.

212
00:16:15,185 --> 00:16:18,348
Really? Then say this.

213
00:16:19,189 --> 00:16:21,623
Moon Prism Power Makeup!

214
00:16:21,892 --> 00:16:23,052
Okay.

215
00:16:23,293 --> 00:16:26,160
Moon Prism Power Makeup!

216
00:17:07,871 --> 00:17:12,205
No way! What is this? I've transformed.

217
00:17:12,809 --> 00:17:16,404
What is this? What does
this mean? Tell me.

218
00:17:17,281 --> 00:17:20,717
Help! Someone! Help me!

219
00:17:21,251 --> 00:17:22,552
Help! It's my mom!

220
00:17:22,552 --> 00:17:23,220
That's Naru's voice.
What does it mean?
Help! It's my mom!

221
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,789
That's Naru's voice.
What does it mean?

222
00:17:25,789 --> 00:17:27,347
Now do you believe me?

223
00:17:27,591 --> 00:17:30,856
I don't really get it, but Naru
seems to be in danger.

224
00:17:31,428 --> 00:17:34,598
Usagi, you have become Sailor Moon.

225
00:17:34,598 --> 00:17:36,589
Now go and save her quickly.

226
00:17:41,438 --> 00:17:42,735
Help me!

227
00:17:46,043 --> 00:17:47,408
I...

228
00:17:49,146 --> 00:17:50,545
Stop it, Mom!

229
00:17:51,782 --> 00:17:54,216
I'm not your mom!

230
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:04,617
Your mom is locked up
in the basement.

231
00:18:05,062 --> 00:18:08,896
After I kill you, I'll send her to
the other world with you.

232
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,163
Get away from Naru!

233
00:18:19,476 --> 00:18:20,966
Who are you?

234
00:18:21,244 --> 00:18:28,514
Um, I'm the Sailor Warrior
of Love and Justice.

235
00:18:33,023 --> 00:18:34,581
Sailor Moon!

236
00:18:36,259 --> 00:18:39,524
In the name of the moon,
I will punish you!

237
00:18:40,063 --> 00:18:44,659
Sailor Moon? I've never heard
of such a thing.

238
00:18:45,035 --> 00:18:51,099
Awaken! My slaves that gave their
energy to my great ruler.

239
00:18:55,946 --> 00:18:58,073
Hey, what are you people?

240
00:19:10,127 --> 00:19:12,391
Oh no! I'm bleeding!

241
00:19:12,863 --> 00:19:14,965
What are you doing, Sailor Moon?

242
00:19:14,965 --> 00:19:18,366
You have to fight. You have
to destroy that monster.

243
00:19:21,571 --> 00:19:27,271
Why? Why is this happening to me?

244
00:19:29,112 --> 00:19:31,137
I'm going home.

245
00:19:32,215 --> 00:19:33,773
This is the end.

246
00:19:46,763 --> 00:19:47,923
Who's there?

247
00:19:49,466 --> 00:19:51,559
I am Tuxedo Mask.

248
00:19:51,902 --> 00:19:55,668
Crying isn't going to solve
anything, Sailor Moon.

249
00:19:55,939 --> 00:19:58,567
But I...

250
00:20:08,351 --> 00:20:09,978
Stop crying.

251
00:20:11,655 --> 00:20:15,386
Take the tiara and yell,
"Moon Tiara Action" and throw it!

252
00:20:15,959 --> 00:20:18,094
Why do I have to do that?

253
00:20:18,094 --> 00:20:18,695
Just hurry up and do it!
Why do I have to do that?

254
00:20:18,695 --> 00:20:19,559
Just hurry up and do it!

255
00:20:35,879 --> 00:20:40,145
Moon Tiara Action!

256
00:20:50,961 --> 00:20:52,121
No way!

257
00:21:02,572 --> 00:21:05,632
Morga, you screwed up. You idiot!

258
00:21:16,586 --> 00:21:18,053
Good job, Sailor Moon!

259
00:21:19,489 --> 00:21:21,821
I'll remember this night.

260
00:21:27,731 --> 00:21:29,699
You did well, Sailor Moon.

261
00:21:30,867 --> 00:21:32,391
He's gorgeous.

262
00:21:36,206 --> 00:21:39,369
Hey, I had a really wonderful
dream last night.

263
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:43,313
A warrior of justice named
Sailor Moon appeared

264
00:21:43,313 --> 00:21:45,215
and destroyed this monster.

265
00:21:45,215 --> 00:21:47,450
What? I had the same dream!

266
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:48,618
Me too!

267
00:21:48,618 --> 00:21:50,253
How strange.

268
00:21:50,253 --> 00:21:53,984
Hey, Usagi. Usagi. Listen!

269
00:21:55,358 --> 00:22:00,990
Be quiet. I'm tired, so let me
sleep a little more.

270
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,028
Good night.

271
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:13,928
In my dream, you and I were together

272
00:22:14,173 --> 00:22:20,840
Protected by the stars

273
00:22:31,257 --> 00:22:36,024
When we were friends,
it didn't bother us

274
00:22:37,997 --> 00:22:43,162
And we casually talked to each other

275
00:22:44,704 --> 00:22:51,940
But there was a moment when
I noticed only you

276
00:22:52,345 --> 00:22:58,978
I want to become prettier
right here and now

277
00:23:00,086 --> 00:23:06,491
Something changes when
you fall in love

278
00:23:06,826 --> 00:23:13,061
I close my eyes and check
to make sure

279
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:26,945
I want to convey the thrill I felt
when we held each other
